# CancerGNN: A deep graph learning pipeline for genomic data analysis

[![Python 3.9.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9.7-yellow.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/)

## Installation

### Conda
Installation should work out of the box for Conda:

``` conda env create -f cancerenv1.yml -n cancerenv ```

Of course, you should first install Conda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
Choose `yes` for running `conda init`. You can disable automatically activating the
base Conda environment by running `conda config --set auto_activate_base false`. This is
useful if you work with both `conda` and `venv` environments on the same machine.

### Venv
For now support is spotty for `venv` installation. You can start with

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

This sometimes fails for some packages, which can then be installed manually. Running
the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command again should then fix things.

If having trouble with `pyg`, try the instructions [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html).


## Running

Ensure that the proper data is placed in subfolders of `data`. The `samples.txt` in each
of the three existing subfolders, `brain`, `kidney`, and `lung`, indicate which files
from the TCGA dataset are used. In addition to the TCGA raw files, each `data` subfolder
needs to contain a gene graph called `gene_graph.gz`.

Training and testing can be achieved using `03-main.py`. To run

``` python 03-main.py ```

Use

``` python 03-main.py --help ```

for options.

## Outline

![pipeline](figures/cancer_gnn_pipeline.png?raw=true)

We treat the genomic data of each sample as a graph, where each gene stands for a node,
gene-gene interactions are defined as edges and taken from [HumanBase](https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/).
Each gene (node) is associated with node features. In this project,  we used pretained
neural networks to extract 128-dim features for each gene. Specifically, we used Xpresso
[1] to encode the non-coding regions; we used UniRep [2] to encode the coding regions. 

### Generating pre-processed gene graph -- this is subject to change

Run `01-network_id_conversion.py` to convert HumanBase to TCGA gene identifiers. Then
run `02-trasfer_hb_graph.py` to read the graph, symmetrize edges (the original data
contains edges in one direction only), and store as a Python pickle.
