# CancerGNN: A deep graph learning pipeline for genomic data analysis

[![Python 3.9.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9.7-yellow.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/)

## Installation

### Conda
Start by setting up the environment: switch to the repo folder and run

``` conda env create -f environment.yml ```

Of course, you should first install Conda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
Choose `yes` for running `conda init`. You can disable automatically activating the
base Conda environment by running `conda config --set auto_activate_base false`. This is
useful if you work with both `conda` and `venv` environments on the same machine.

Next activate the environment and install the package using

``` 
conda activate cancerenv
pip install .
```

For development, make an editable install:

``` 
conda activate cancerenv
pip install -e .
```


## Data acquisition
NB the data files involved are ~20GB. If you want to store these outside the repo, we suggest setting `cancer-net/data` as a symlink to elsewhere on your system where you would like to store the data. Then proceed with the following steps:
1. Run `bash pull_data.sh` to download data files.
2. Preprocess the HumanBase graph connections by running `python3 01-network_id_conversion.py` inside the conda environment. This converts the HumanBase genes to TCGA gene identifiers.


## Running

Find notebooks in the [demos](demos/) folder.
