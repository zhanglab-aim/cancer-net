    """A much larger network based on extended graph convolutional operators.
    
    This uses a dropout followed by a fully-connected layer with ReLU to blow up the
    input node attributes to `hidden_channels`-dimensions, then passes the resulting
    graph through a series of graph convolutional operators with initial residual
    connections and identity mapping (GCNII). This basically averages attributes over
    neighboring nodes, like normal `GCN` (see `GCNNet`), but it includes "skip"
    connections to some "initial" representation, and it also "shrinks" the linear
    weights acting on top of the convolution result towards the identity, with stronger
    shrinkage for deeper layers. See `torch_geometric.nn.GCN2Conv` for full details.

    The convolutional operators are followed by pair normalization, which aims to avoid
    oversmoothing (see `torch_geometric.nn.PairNorm`). Dropout layers are used for
    regularization, one before each convolutional layer.

    The result from the graph convolutional layers is passed through an MLP, with class
    predictions obtained by (log) softmax. The MLP also includes a batchnorm layer.

        convolutional layers

    :param theta: strength of identity mapping in `GCN2Conv` layers
    :param num_classes: number of output classes
    :param shared_weights: whether to use different weight matrices for the convolution
        result and the initial residual; see `torch_geometric.nn.GCN2Conv`
    :param dropout: dropout strength
    :param output_intermediate: if true, the module outputs not only the final class
        prediction, but also:
            `x1`: the result after the graph convolutional layers
            `x2`: the result from the global pooling
